// Problem 5 (1 point).
//
// An adversary analyzes a sequence of (ciphertext) characters, which is encrypted
// by Vigenere Cipher, using Kasishiâ€™s method. In addition, it knows the key
// length is at least 2. If it can find a sub-string with a length of 4 repeated
// twice in the sequence, and the distance between the two repeated sub-strings is
// 12, what are the possible key length of this Vigenere cipher?

// Solution
// key length = gcd(4, 12) = 4
